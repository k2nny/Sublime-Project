		<p>The event team is broken up into 4 positions. As you take on more resposibilites, you gain more permissions. The organization of the team is as follows:</p>
		<!-- Body of Team Structure -->
		<div style="width: 50%; height: 200px; float: left; padding-right: 20px; color: #7DB264; ">
			<p> <b><u>Helper | Coord Trainee:</u></b>
			Helpers are responsible for hosting events, promoting server activity, and welcoming new members. They have access to Invite Log, Sesh commands, and Event management.</p>
		</div>
			
		<div style="margin-left: 50%; height: 200px; color: #8AD26E;">
			<p> <b><u>Organizer | Jr. Coord:</u></b>
			Organizers retain all responsibilities of subordinates. In addition, they create event ideas, fulfill approved event submissions, assist Sr. Event Staff in training sessions, and announce & promote approved events. Organizers have the same permissions as Helpers.</p>
